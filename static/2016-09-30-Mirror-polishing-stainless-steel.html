<p> I've at least halfway successfully sanded down stainless but by no means consider myself an expert, and had quite
    a hard time doing it.  I used an orbital sander and belt sander when really what was needed was probably a bench sander with a sanding belt.  These bench sanders
    with a belt ( I'm thinking of a company called Jet that make them ) probably have a motor that spins at higher RPM.  In a side note, I worked with a 
    very skilled engineering technician, who was in his sixties, and one of the things he was most proud of, was a project he made in high school shop class,
    a bench belt sander, off of what he described as 'the motor to a washing machine'.  He let me use it, and I can attest to the fact that it was arguably
    better than any sander I've used today, including some of these expensive benchtop belted sanders.  What made his great was the way the sanding belt had
    some give to it and you could really lay into a work piece if needed.  It spun crazy fast and would really get some sparks flying off the metal.</p>

    <p> I was able to get a somewhat good polish on some quarter inch stainless bar that I needed for the decorative range hood I was making for my kitchen.
        The process works like this.  Start with whatever grit is needed to level off the material, say 40 grit or 80 grit.  Then just make may passes over
        the workpiece at each level of grit as you pass through, e.g. 40 grit then move on to 80 grit, then 100, then 120, 150, 180, 220, 320...etc
        You can puchase fine grit papers all the way up to 2000 for an orbital sander, for example to get the piece mostly polished. </p>

        <p> I had read and can confirm that if you miss some of face of the metal with one pass, as soon as you move on to the next pass it will not smooth out,
        and end up in your finished product.  I believe this is called 'pitting'. It makes logical sense that if the metal has a pit in it where sand paper will
        not reach, even as the piece continues to get sanded, it probably won't reach the pitted part, because the less gritty the paper, the less material is getting worked
        off a surface that is already above that of the pitted parts </p>.

 This bar stock was sanded down progressively with primarily a orbital sander, and then finished with a buffer wheel and some chalks.</figcaption>

    <p> I read some forums and found some hotly debated topic as to how best to mirror polish stainless, and it really seems like there are two camps of people dealing
    with this issue.  Either use a buffer or sand it down ( as described above ).  Well I actually did both for my project.  The sanding really did the lion's share
    of mirror polishing, while the buffer seemed more of a less substantial polishing of the metal.  I suppose this makes sense.  I believe I did try polishing
    some test pieces of the raw stainless stock ( with mill scale and all! ) with the buffer wheel and its chalks.  It seemed like it was making less of a finish
    than sanding.</p>

  the manufacturing process, it yielded a better result than just the progressive sanding and buffer wheel process I used in my garage</figcaption>

    <p> In short I found it very difficult and time consuming to finish raw 304 stainless to a mirror polished state, but I got close enough to a desired result for my house project.
        I would be curious about others' experience doing this.  As mentioned earlier, I think I would like to try next time with a higher RPM benchtop belt sander
        so i can make sure the material on the surface of the workpiece is as uniform as possible before moving on to another type of grit.  Also does anyone have
        any ideas on having your consumables budget (sandpaper) not start eating its way into the total cost of doing a project ? </p>

        <p> I read alot of things about how to achieve mirror polish of stainless on the internet from raw stock before starting myself, and I found
        the information on the web to be fractured at best, where I was getting one persons opinion on one part of the process rather than a more holistic
        start-to-finish diy solution.  </p>
